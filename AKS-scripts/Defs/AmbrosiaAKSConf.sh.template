# Rename this file to AmbrosiaAKSConf.sh (in the same directory) but
# DO NOT check it in.  Modify it to include your configuration info
# and secrets.
#
# This file can be used to to deploy multiple application instances
# (pods) into a single Kubernetes cluster.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The values in this file are just placeholders, but are meant to be
# somewhat suggestive ones.  EVERY value is mandatory.
#
# SUGGESTION: you can get away with doing only TWO things here:
#
#  (1) fill in AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION with your subscription ID.
#
#  (2) find/replace "xyz" with a unique string, such as your github username
#      The string you use must NOT contain '-' or '_'!
#      (Azure storage and container registry are very restrictive in this respect.)
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The descriptive overall name of your AMBROSIA service (which may contain
# multiple instances, each of which contain multiple replicas).
AMBROSIA_SERVICE_NAME=perftest

# Find this in the Azure portal or with `az account list --output table`
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION=PASTE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_HERE
# Where to put resources we create:
AZURE_LOCATION=eastus
DOCKER_EMAIL=xyz@xyz.com

# These must be GLOBALLY unique.
# They are not scoped per-subscription or per-resource group.
# ------------------------------------------------------------
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=xyz-group
AZURE_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER=xyz-cluster
ACR_NAME=xyzcontainerreg
AZURE_STORAGE_NAME=xyzstorage
SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME=xyz-aks-acr-service-principal
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# These variables don't need to be changed.
# You can use these defaults:
# ------------------------------------------------------------
ACR_SECRET_NAME=acr-auth-secret
FILESHARE_NAME=ambrosia-logs-smbshare
FILESHARE_SECRET_NAME=azure-fileshare-secret
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# See Defs/Set-*.sh for variables that are retrieved automatically after login.
